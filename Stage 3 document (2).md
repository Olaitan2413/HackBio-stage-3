**Phase 2:**

**A. WHO Cholera Outbreak Report  of the world between** 

* **Total Cases**: 9180678

* **Total Deaths**:  897204

* **Significant Outbreaks**:

  * *From the maps, it was observed that most outbreak Fatality occurred in Africa with more concentration in West Africa/ sub saharan Africa and such a trend was also observed in Central Africa/South Africa*. A part of the middle belt also recorded a moderate fatality rate. It was also observed that data was not collected from a number of countries.

* **Trends**:

  * *Year-over-Year Trend*: the greatest outbreak occurred between the years 2000-2010 but the highest cumulative outbreak occurs between the 1990-1999, although the cumulative number of cases have reduced in the next decade and another rise was observed.

  * One major take is that the death rate is reducing over the year. 

**B. Summary Template For Reporting Cholera Outbreak Data For Any Country, Including Key Metrics And Trends.**

**Country Name:** The name of the country to be investigated  
**Date:**

**Key Metrics that should be measured are**

* **Total Outbreaks:**

* **Total Cases:**

* **Total Deaths:**

* **Most Affected Regions:**

**Trends and Patterns:** This should include informations such as

* Year with the Highest Cases, Deaths and the the year with the highest fatality rate :

* Recent Outbreak Trends to determine if there is a slide or exponential increase, this can be reasonable for prevention purposes focusing on the major cause:

* Comparison with Previous Years:

**Visualizations:**

Visual representations can be used to show the trend and severity of cholera infection over a range of studied years. Such representation in this case can include:

* **Time-Series Graphs**

* **Heat Maps**

* **Epidemiological Curves**

* **Mortality vs. Incidence Ratios**

* **Comparative Bar Charts.**

**Conclusion:**

This should include the Summary of the major findings and possible causes of the outbreak, and Recommendations for public health measures in order to reduce present outbreak and prevent further outbreaks can also be provided.
