**Phase 2:**

**WHO Cholera Outbreak Report  of the world** 

The data reported on global cholera outbreaks over a 70-year period from 1949 to 2019 , focusing on three key metrics: total cases, total deaths, and case fatality rate by country. During this period, a total of 9,180,678 cholera cases and 897,204 deaths were reported, resulting in an overall case fatality rate of 9.77%.

The total number of cholera cases fluctuated between 1949 and 1989, as shown in Fig 1, after which a major spike in total number of cases occurred between 1990 and 1999\. A subsequent decrease was followed by a slight increase observed from 2000 to 2019\. The variation in cases over time may be linked to improved reporting, as more countries began to document outbreaks. Notably, the number of deaths declined significantly over the years, with the highest death toll recorded between 1950 and 1959 (Fig 1). This reduction can likely be attributed to better disease management strategies.  ![Figure 1](https://github.com/Olaitan2413/HackBio-stage-3/blob/main/Visualization/WHO%20cholera%20cases%20and%20death%20frequency%20over%20time.jpeg?raw=true)
   (Fig 1)

Three major peaks in cholera outbreaks were observed in 1953, 1991, and 2011, as illustrated in the epidemiological curve (Fig 2), with the highest number of cases occurring in 2011 (Fig 3). ![Figure 2](https://github.com/Olaitan2413/HackBio-stage-3/blob/main/Visualization/epidemiological%20curve%20showing%20number%20of%20cases%20over%20the%20years.jpeg?raw=true)

(Fig 3)
Fatality rates were highest in Africa, particularly in West and Southern Africa, as shown in Fig 4\. Niger recorded the highest fatality rate in West Africa, followed by Libya, Mali, and Nigeria, which share borders with Niger. Botswana and Zimbabwe reported the highest fatality rates in Southern Africa, suggesting potential cross-border transmission. Some Middle Eastern regions also had moderate fatality rates, with Sri Lanka and Panama reporting the highest fatality rates in their respective regions. A small portion of Europe also experienced significant fatality rates. ![Figure 4](https://github.com/Olaitan2413/HackBio-stage-3/blob/main/Visualization/World%20Cholera%20fatality%20rate%20distribution%20over%20time.jpeg?raw=true)
(Fig 4)

The data (Fig 4\) shows that low-income countries were disproportionately affected by higher fatality rates. It was also noted that data from several countries were missing during this period, as shown in the Global Cholera Fatality Rate graph (Fig 5). To gain a more accurate understanding of the global cholera situation, updated and comprehensive reports from these regions are needed.
